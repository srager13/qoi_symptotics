%we could start by saying photonet considers similartiy-based image collection(diversity metric), and mediascope considers different queries and timeliness, but the transmission rates were not detailed. here, we consider an actual network etc.

We adopt the symptotic scalability framework \cite{scalability_manets_theory_vs_practice}, which has been previously applied to content-agnostic static networks \cite{symptotics_framework_scalability} and mobile networks \cite{scal_analysis_mobility}.  Other works that characterize capacity of wireless networks, like \cite{li_capacity, gupta2000capacity, nom_cap_wmns}, do so asymptotically or for only one specific network instead of developing a general model.

Similarity-based image collection has previously been considered \cite{photonet,media scope}. In \cite{photonet}, authors consider a DTN network where the objective is to collect the most diverse set of pictures at every node.  Authors consider a picture prioritization and dropping mechanism in order to maximize the diversity, defined by dissimilarities of the collection of pictures. However, it does not consider attributes of timeliness, nor the consideration of transmission rates and network topology.  \cite{mediascope} considers a smartphone application where different queries called top-K, spanner, and K-means clustering are defined.  Each of these queries are based on image similarity metrics, and we use top-k and spanner here. While timeliness is considered as an objective in this work, the effect of rates and network topology is overlooked.

A large number of works provide definitions for and frameworks that utilize Quality of Information.  \cite{qoi_aware_tactical_mil_nets, qoi_aware_trx_pol_time_vary_links} specify a framework called Operational Information Content Capacity, which describes a framework of the obtainable region of QoI, similar to this work.  These approaches use a more general network model, though, and do not provide any method for determining the possible size of the network or impact of various network design choices like medium access protocols.  

QoI-based scheduling has been considered from a number of various angles, including control choices of data selection \cite{dcoss_max_cov, opt_qoi_data_collection_bijarbooneh}, routing \cite{quality_aware_routing_tan}, and scheduling/rate control \cite{qoi_sched_task_proc_nets, toward_qoi_rate_control}.  It is also the focus of a credibility-aware optimization technique in \cite{social_swarming}.  Work in \cite{qoi_aware_mobile_apps} is related in that it evaluates the impact of varying QoI requirements on usage of network resources.  However, the analysis is not done in an applied manner as we do here. 

Need more on these???:  Time varying queues, QoI outage, Freshness-based for multiple sensors.
