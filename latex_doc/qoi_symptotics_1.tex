\boldmath
%area
Practical network scalability, known as \emph{symptotics}, has obvious applications in designing ad hoc networks.  
%problem
In any practical implementation, knowing the limitations on scalability, the capabilities of deliverable QoI, and the impact of QoI requirements are crucial to designing an operational, effective network.
%solution
To obtain upper limits on network scalability and, more importantly, to understand how these limits are impacted by QoI functions and requirements, we apply QoI awareness to the symptotics framework.
%methodology
We use two similarity-based image retrieval algorithms to motivate and exemplify the relationship between timely QoI requirements and network scalability.
%results
Results show that high QoI and strict timeliness requirements can have a large impact on scalability, which gives a much clearer understanding of the tradeoffs present in network design.  We also introduce and show examples of \emph{scalably feasible QoI regions} for special cases, showing clear limitations on QoI requirements that are able to be satisfied by these networks.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

%\begin{abstract}
%
%In many deployments of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the primary goal is to collect and deliver data from many nodes to a designated operation center to support situation awareness and decision-making.  Additionally, this goal must be met while considering the limited resources, such as battery life, in the wireless nodes.  Traditional MANET protocols and research focus on providing protocols that are evaluated on performance criteria such as throughput and delay.  In this work, we extend this notion to include emphasis on the usefulness of data content along with traditional network state indicators such as current channel conditions to make cross-layer control decisions.  First we develop the notion of an information space created by generated data. Next, we formulate the problem of maximizing coverage over this information space while restricting individual node costs to remain within a given budget.  We then provide an algorithm that provides the solution to this problem.  Next we consider the related problem of finding the optimal long-term average coverage subject to average cost constraints and give its solution, which uses Lyapunov Optimization techniques.  For real world implementations, we also provide computationally feasible approximation algorithms for optimal solutions of both problems, including a novel technique that uses virtual queues for the average maximum coverage problem.  Finally, we provide simulation results of all proposed algorithms.  These results not only demonstrate the benefits of considering data content in scheduling, but also show the advantages from using the long-term average solution and the near-optimal performance of our greedy virtual queue approximation algorithm.
